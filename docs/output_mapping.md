**Template:** ANZ-GENERIC_ForeignUplift.xlsx
**Output Name:** `<input_basename>_parsed.xlsx` (e.g. `XQ-4076249.pdf` → `XQ-4076249_parsed.xlsx`)

This file describes how parsed `LineItem` fields are written into the standardised internal template. The template has a single sheet named `Foreign Uplift` with 27 columns A→AA. Every output is a clean copy of the template (no fills, no fonts, no borders, no merged cells) — only values, with date columns carrying a `DD/MM/YYYY` number format.

**Output structure**
- **Row 1**: column L only carries the literal note `(Optional for Software and/or Services)`. All other cells in row 1 are empty.
- **Row 2**: 27 header labels, in the exact order shown below.
- **Rows 3 … N+2**: one line item per row, populated per the field mapping below.
- **Row N+3** (the row immediately after the last line item): the end-loop escape row. Column B = `*`, column D = `DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE. Indicate * on column B to mark the end loop. Add / remove lines above as necessary.` All other cells in this row are empty.

The `*` in column B is required — our quoting system uses it as the loop sentinel when it imports this file.

**Header row (row 2)**

| M | `Serial Number` |
| N | `Warranty / Duration (months)` |
| O | `Vendor Ref` |
| P | `Start Date` |
| Q | `End Date` |

**Field mapping (data rows)**

| Col | Header | Source | Notes |
|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| A | Item | auto-increment from 1 | Row index in the output (1, 2, 3, …) |
| B | Vendor Name | hardcoded `"NUTANIX"` | All formats for now (only Nutanix is supported). |
| C | IMTH SKU | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |
| D | Vendor Part Number | `vpn` | |
| E | Description | `description` | Empty for Renewal (Renewal doesn't extract a description). |
| F | Qty. | `qty` | |
| G | Unit Price | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |
| H | MSRP | _empty_ | **Always blank.** The parser's `msrp` value lands in column U only. |
| I | Cost | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |
| J | Discount | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |
| K | Margin | hardcoded `5.00` | Will become a UI-driven input later. |
| L | Product Part Number (Warranty/Renewal) | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |
| M | Serial Number | _empty_ | **Always blank.** The parser's `serial_number` value lands in column R (Comments) instead. |
| N | Warranty / Duration (months) | `term` | **Only written when `term >= 1`.** If `term` is null or `0`, leave the cell empty. |
| O | Vendor Ref | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |
| P | Start Date | `start_date` | Native Excel date; cell format `DD/MM/YYYY`. Empty if null. |
| Q | End Date | `end_date` | Same as Start Date. |
| R | Comments | `serial_number` | Written verbatim (no `"License: "` prefix, no other formatting). Empty if `serial_number` is null. |
| S | Foreign Currency | hardcoded `"USD"` | All quotes parsed so far are USD-denominated. |
| T | Foreign Cost | `cost` | |
| U | Foreign MSRP | `msrp` | This is where the parser's MSRP value lives. |
| V | Foreign Exchange Rate | hardcoded `1.000` | Will become a UI-driven input later. |
| W–AA | (other) | _empty_ | Manual / future enrichment. |

**Locked output rules (decided iteratively with the user, in order)**
1. Local `MSRP` (column H) is **never** populated. The parser's `msrp` value lives in `Foreign MSRP` (column U) only.
2. Bundled-component rows (Hardware Only Quote D rows where the supplier left price cells blank) get `msrp = 0` and `cost = 0` at parse time — those land as numeric `0` in T and U, not blank cells.
3. `Warranty / Duration (months)` (column N) is **only written when `term >= 1`**. A term of `0` or null is treated as "no term" and the cell is left empty.
4. `Serial Number` column (M) is **never** populated. The supplier's serial-cell string (which may contain an embedded license number, e.g. `"24SW000351227,LIC-02472987"`) is written verbatim into `Comments` (column R) instead. No `"License: "` prefix, no splitting.
5. Numbers are written as raw values — no forced decimal places. Excel will display `383` rather than `383.00` unless a cell format is applied; this is intentional.
6. Dates are written as native `date` values with the cell number format `DD/MM/YYYY` so Excel displays them as DD/MM/YYYY but they remain sortable/filterable as real dates.

**Filename**
The output file is named `<input_basename>_parsed.xlsx` where `<input_basename>` is the source filename without its extension. So:
- `XQ-4076249.pdf` → `XQ-4076249_parsed.xlsx`
- `XQ-4076249.xlsx` → `XQ-4076249_parsed.xlsx` (collides with the PDF in batch reviews; in production only one envelope is processed per parse).
